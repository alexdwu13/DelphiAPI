# Delphi-API

## Setup

Before starting you'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac) up and running on your machine and a local Ethereum network running on your localhost:8545. [Deth](https://github.com/c-o-l-o-r/deth) plays nicely with this setup.

###### Starting Up A Private Ethereum Blockchain & Delphoying Delphi
```
git clone https://github.com/c-o-l-o-r/deth.git
cd deth/dapp
git clone https://github.com/BKDaugherty/delphi-unchained.git
cd ..
docker-compose up --build
docker exec -it deth_dapp_1 bash
root@deth_dapp: cd delphi-unchained
root@deth_dapp: npm install
root@deth_dapp: truffle install
root@deth_dapp: yarn contract
```
###### Runing the caching layer
```
git clone https://github.com/c-o-l-o-r/DelphiAPI.git
cd DelphiAPI
docker-compose up --build
docker exec -it delphiapi_delphi_subscriber bash
root@delphi_subscriber: python migrate.py
docker exec -it delphiapi_contract_subscriber bash
root@contract_subscriber: npm install
root@contract_subscriber: npm start
```

## Setup
[Download Docker stable version](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac)
```
docker volume create --name redis_bounties
docker volume create --name psql_bounties
docker-compose up
```

Locally, you will now be syncing directly from the contract. You may access the api at:

http://locahost:5000

If you add additional packages to a package.json or to the requirements.txt file, you'll need to rebuild the individual service.  To rebuild all services, you may run:
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
By default, the sync will connect to deth. To change to a rinkeby sync or other, you will need to adjust the eth_network key in the [environment file](/.env). As an example, it can be changed to `eth_network=rinkeby`.

## API Schema and Documentation

We plan to closely follow the architecture described in the [BountiesAPI repo](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/BountiesAPI).

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](/docs/images/architecture.jpg)

The **frontend or client** can be any third party service or collaborator that integrates with the [delphi ethereum contract](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/Delphi).  This API works as a caching and storage layer for what is input into the standard bounties contract. Due to storage costs, the contract puts the majority of the data into IPFS. To understand further, read the documentation on the [Delphi contract](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/Delphi).

The [**contract subscriber**](/contract_subscriber) listens for events from the contract. In the case a resync is occurring, it will listen to all historical events, starting from the genesis block. In order for the subscriber to know what it has already accessed, the redis cache stores a currentBlock key. Additionally, the redis cache stores the hashes for all transactions that have already been evaluated and stored to the db. The contract subscriber will ignore transactions that have already been written, and will not search through blocks prior to the currentBlock key. When the subscriber picks up on a new event, it looks up the original transaction via web3 and passes the event data along with the original contract function inputs to SQS.  An SQS fifo queue is used. This means we will never have duplication on keys and all events will be handled in the order they come through.

The [**delphi subscriber**](/delphi_api/app/event_processor) listens to events that have been passed into RabbitMQ by the contract subscriber.  The delphi subscriber uses the data from the event, the inputs to the original contract function, and the IPFS stored data to write the appropriate values to the DB via SQLAlchemy.

The [**delphi api**](/delphi_api) is a falcon API that serves the data that has been written by the delphi subscriber and other running jobs.
